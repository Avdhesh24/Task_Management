Task Management App
This is a Task Management application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The app has two main components:

Frontend: Developed using Flutter, providing a user-friendly mobile interface.
Backend: Developed using Spring Boot, offering a secure and robust API for managing tasks and users.
Features
Frontend (Flutter)
User Authentication: Allows users to sign up and log in.
Task Management: Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks.
Task Details: View detailed information about each task.
Task Status: Mark tasks as completed or in-progress.
Responsive UI: The app is optimized for both Android and web devices.
Backend (Spring Boot)
User Registration & Login: Endpoints for user registration and login.
Task Management: APIs to create, update, delete, and retrieve tasks.
JWT Authentication: Secure login using JWT tokens for authentication.
Database: Uses a relational database (like MySQL) to store users and tasks.
Technologies Used
Frontend (Flutter):

Flutter SDK
Dart Programming Language
Provider for state management
HTTP package for API integration
Backend (Spring Boot):

Spring Security
Spring Data JPA
JWT for authentication
MySQL for persistent storage
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Before starting the setup, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Flutter SDK: Flutter Installation Guide
Java JDK (version 17 or later): JDK Installation Guide
MySQL Database : MySQL Installation Guide
Spring Boot (via Spring Tool Suite or IntelliJ IDEA): Spring Boot Setup

Set up Database:
Update the application.properties file with your database credentials:
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/task_management
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password

Run the Backend:
Open the project in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).
Run the TaskApplication.java class.
The server will start on localhost:8080.

Frontend Setup (Flutter)
Install Dependencies:
flutter pub get

Run the App:
Connect an Android or web device/emulator.
Run the Flutter app:
flutter run

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Before starting the setup, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Flutter SDK: Flutter Installation Guide
Java JDK (version 17 or later): JDK Installation Guide
MySQL Database (or H2 Database for testing): MySQL Installation Guide
Spring Boot (via Spring Tool Suite or IntelliJ IDEA): Spring Boot Setup
Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
Clone the Backend Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <your-backend-repository-url>
cd <backend-folder>
Set up Database:

Create a MySQL database called task_management.
Update the application.properties or application.yml file with your database credentials:
properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/task_management
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
Run the Backend:

Open the project in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).
Run the TaskManagementApplication.java class.
The server will start on localhost:8080.
Frontend Setup (Flutter)
Clone the Flutter Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <your-flutter-repository-url>
cd <flutter-folder>
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Update API URLs:

Open the Flutter project and update the API base URL in the constants.dart file to match your backend server URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
Run the App:

Connect an Android or iOS device/emulator.
Run the Flutter app:
flutter run

API Endpoints (Backend)
User Endpoints
POST /api/auth/register - Register a new user.
POST /api/auth/login - Login a user and receive a JWT token.
Task Endpoints
GET /api/tasks - Get all tasks for the logged-in user.
POST /api/tasks - Create a new task.
PUT /api/tasks/{id} - Update an existing task.
DELETE /api/tasks/{id} - Delete a task.
Authentication
POST /api/auth/login - Logs in the user and returns a JWT token. The token should be included in the headers for subsequent API calls.
